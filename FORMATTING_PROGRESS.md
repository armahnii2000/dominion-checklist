# Dominion Checklist Formatting Progress

## Project Overview

This repository contains a transcript of a sermon by Apostle Joshua Selman titled "Dominion Checklist [End of Year Appraisals]" based on 2 Peter 1:21, delivered in 2025. The sermon covers 18 "mysteries of the kingdom" - principles that lead to victory and dominion in Christian life.

## Task

We are formatting the raw transcript (originally `blank.md`, now `Dominion Checklist.md`) into a well-structured, readable document with:
- Proper section headers
- Appropriate paragraph breaks
- Subsections where needed
- Indented first lines for paragraphs (using `&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`)

## Key Formatting Rules

1. **No text edits** - Only structural changes (sections, paragraphs, headers)
2. **Preserve all original text** - Including `>>` markers, original spelling, capitalization
3. **Proper paragraphs** - Related sentences flow together; break only when topic/focus shifts
4. **First-line indentation** - Each paragraph starts with `&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`
5. **Subsections** - Use `###` for subsections within major sections (`##`)

## Sections Completed ✅

1. **Opening Worship** - Scripture reading (Psalm 95:1-3)
2. **Thanksgiving** - WITH SUBSECTIONS:
   - Call to Thanksgiving
   - Corporate Thanksgiving
   - Prayer of Thanksgiving
   - Closing
3. **Welcome & Acknowledgments** - Greeting and guest appreciations
4. **Announcements** - WITH SUBSECTIONS:
   - School of Ministry Programs
   - Ministry Break Explained
   - Final Service & Resumption
5. **Introduction to the Main Teaching** - WITH SUBSECTIONS:
   - Foundations of Victory
   - Purpose of Tonight's Teaching
   - The Checklist

## Sections Remaining

Based on my original outline:

6. **Scripture Foundation** (2 Peter 1:12, 1 Timothy 4:15, 2 Corinthians 13:5)
7. **Ministry Mandate and Personal Testimony**
8. **Three Levels of Knowledge Framework**
9. **Introduction to the Checklist** (may already be part of section 5)
10. **The 18 Mysteries** - Each mystery should likely be its own subsection or section:
    - Mystery #1: Value and supremacy of the Word
    - Mystery #2: Power of prayer
    - Mystery #3: Power of vision, purpose, and destiny
    - Mystery #4: Power of belief systems
    - Mysteries #5-18 (need to identify from transcript)
11. **Closing Sections** - Likely includes:
    - End-of-year sacrifice teaching
    - Altar call
    - Final benediction
